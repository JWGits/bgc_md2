# # Matrix Model Intercomparison Project: Traceability Analysis
# <p>We use the <a href="https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/bgc_md2">bgc_md2</a> package infrastructure to compare two or more models using traceability analysis approach (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12172">Xia et al. 2013</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-145-2017">Luo et al. 2017</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2017MS001004">Jiang et al. 2017</a>) modified for transient simulations of the TRENDY model intercomparison project. </p>
# <p>The biogeochemical models from the TRENDY project have been reconstructed from literature using matrix approach (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2002GB001923">Luo et al. 2003</a>, <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12766">2015</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-5-1045-2012">Sierra et al. 2012</a>) and <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">sympy</a> python package in the <a href="https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/bgc_md2">bgc_md2</a> database. Currently the models are simplified to be driven by NPP and thus omitting explicit simulation of leaf processes and autotrophic respiration. Data assimilation (<a href=" https://doi.org/10.1890/09-1275.1">Luo et al. 2011</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2015GB005239">2015</a>) was used to optimize parameters of reconstructed models to fit TRENDY output.</p>
# <p>Currently our analysis includes the following steps:
# <ol>
# <li>We start by comparing model outputs - <em><strong>C storage</strong></em> ($X$) over time. Then we compute and compare traceable components to investigate sources of discrepancy between model predictions of C storage, and thus sources of uncertainty in our understanding of global C dynamics. </li>
# <li>We compute <em><strong>C storage capacity </strong></em> $X_{C}$ for each model. $X_{C}$ (as a function of time) represents the maximum C storage for the system under current conditions. 
# It is a theoretically predicted steady state of the autonomous system that we would obtain if we froze our original non-autonomous system at time point $t_{freeze}$ keeping the conditions (C input and environmental factors) constant after $t_{freeze}$. While $X_{C}$ is not a correct prediction for the solution $X$ of the original time dependent system, it is rather a momentary characteristic of the system that depends on conditions at each point in time.  
# $X_{C}$ is an attractor of the frozen autonomous system, although it is not attracting the real solution  $X$. In a non-autonomous system with variable C input and environmental factors (such as temperature and moisture)  <em><strong>ecosystem</strong></em> $X$ (if we consider ecosystem as a whole - as a <em>"surrogate" 1-pool system</em>, not pool-wise) is constantly chasing $X_{C}$, but cannot consistently reach it due to variable conditions: when $X_{C}$ &gt $X$, $X$ is increasing, and when $X_{C}$ &lt $X$, $X$ is decreasing.</li>
# <li>The difference between $X_{C}$ and $X$ at each point in time is called Â <em><strong>C storage potential </strong></em>($X_{P}$): it shows how far the current C storage of the system is from the theoretical steady state (in a positive or negative direction).</li> 
# <li>$X_{C}$ of each model depends on <em><strong>C input</strong></em> (in our case - $NPP$) and <em><strong>Equilibrium Residence Time </strong></em>($RT$). We compare $NPP$ and $RT$ for each model and attribute the contribution of $NPP$ and $RT$ to the discrepancy of $X_{C}$.</li>
# <li>$RT$ represents the time which it would take on average for C particle to exit the system after it entered it, if the system was at the equilibrium. In a transient simulation, where the system is not at the steady state, $RT$ becomes a dynamic model characteristic that can be interpreted as a measure of the inverse C turnover rate of the system at each point in time. $RT$ depends on the model structure and on environmental factors. To single out environmental effects we determine <em><strong>temperature</strong></em> and <em><strong>moisture sensitivity</strong></em> of $RT$, and compare it between models. We also compare $RT$ at fixed temperatures and moisture conditions (gauge conditions) including minimum, maximum and mean conditions across the period of the simulation.</li>
# <li> Based on the traceable components: $NPP$, $RT$, <em><strong>temperature</strong></em> and <em><strong>moisture sensitivity</strong></em> of $RT$, we can make conclusions regarding the inherent similarity/dissimilarity between the models and single out mechanisms that contribute most to the discrepancy of C predictions. 
# </ol>
# <p>The analysis is currently performed for total global C storage, including vegetation and soil parts. <br> Next steps to expand the analysis may include the following: </p>
# <ul>
# <li>Explore temperature and moisture sensitivities of major fluxes (e.g. litter decomposition, soil respiration);</li> 
# <li>Separetely compare vegetation and soil components for each model;</li> 
# <li>Investigate differences over different biomes;</li>
# <li>Include additional diagnostic variables (e.g. transit time, carbon use efficiency, etc.);</li>
# <li>Expand models by explicitly including autotrophic processes (start from GPP as C input);</li>
# <li>Include sensitivity to more environmental factors and anthropogenic disturbances</li>
# </ul>
# <p>The short description of methodology for deriving traceable components is given below. </p>
