Usecases / Objectives
=====================
* Exploration of existing models:

  The package is supposed to assist in the creation of 'reports' in the form of jupyter notebooks. The notebooks will be of the following types:
  
        * Investigations of a single model (or modelrun).

        * Comparisons between models (modelruns).

* Assistence in the formulation of new models in a step by step process.
  To this end the package contains an exampe notebook 

* `create a carbon cycle model (ipynb) <>`_
  and uses computability graphs 
  to either: 

  * show which addidional results can be computed, given the
    information already present in the models `source.py` or 

  * show which additional information has to be provided in the models `source.py` to be able to obtain the result of the desired type.
